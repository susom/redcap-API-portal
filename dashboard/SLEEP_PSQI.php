		<h3>Short Duration of Sleep</h3>
		<p>The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults between the ages of 18 and 64 receive between 7 and 9 hours of sleep every night, and between 7-8 hours for adults 65 or older.  If you are routinely getting less than 7 hours of sleep at night, it may be affecting your sleep quality.

		<h3>Sleep Disturbance</h3>
		<p>Creating a sleep environment that is free of night time disturbance is critical to good quality sleep.  A sleep disturbance includes anything that wakes you during the night, including the need to use the bathroom, coughing or loud snoring, not being able to breath comfortably, feeling too hot or too cold, experiencing pain, bad dreams, or anything else that can cause you to wake in the night.
