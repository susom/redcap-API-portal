<h2>Sleep Deficiency and its Consequences</h2>
<p>In our fast-paced modern culture, sleep is often the first to be compromised in our effort to meet the competing demands of life.  However, ironically, inadequate sleep substantially hinders our ability to meet those demands.  One night of low quality sleep can result in a number of immediate impacts, including impaired cognitive abilities, slowed reflexes, and increased caloric consumption. In fact, sleep deprivation has similar effects on the body as alcohol.  Being awake for 18 hours straight is similar to having a blood alcohol level of 0.05, and being awake for 24 hours straight is similar to a blood alcohol level of 0.1.  For reference, the legal blood alcohol limit is 0.08.  Drowsy driving has been associated with five to six thousand fatal crashes each year in the U.S..  If you find yourself drowsy driving, immediately pull off the road at a safe place and take a 20-minute nap.  Other options include switching drivers or having a caffeinated beverage.</p> 
<p>Upward of 19% of adults in the U.S. have reported not getting enough sleep everyday, and nearly 40% of adults have reported falling asleep during the day without meaning to at least once a month.Â  Sleep deficiency can interfere with work or school, and social functioning.  While you sleep your brain forms new pathways involved in learning and memory, and inadequate sleep interferes with these processes, as well as focus, creativity, decision-making, and problem-solving skills.  Sleep deficiency has also been shown to alter brain activity, such that controlling emotions and coping with change is more difficult, as is perception of emotional response in others.  Sleep deprivation has been linked to depression, suicide, and risk-taking behavior.</p>
<p>In the long-run, chronic sleep deficiency has been associated with a number of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, depression, kidney disease, and high blood pressure.  We are still learning about all the roles that sleep plays in our health, but we know that sleep is critical for the repair of cells, of the heart, and of blood vessels throughout the body.  The role of sleep deficiency in weight gain has also been well established.  Inadequate sleep interferes with hormone balance in the body that controls appetite regulation.  Sleep deprivation increases the hormone ghrelin (tells us when we're hungry) and decreases the hormone leptin (tells us when we're full), making us feel hungrier than when we are well-rested, which can lead to overeating and weight gain.  Sleep is important in blood sugar control, and inadequate sleep can result in higher blood sugar levels and higher risk for diabetes.  Sleep is also required to maintain a healthy immune system, and inadequate sleep can lead to compromised immunity and trouble fighting common infections.</p>  

<h3>How Do You Know if You're Sleep Deficient?</h3>

<p>Experiencing daytime sleepiness can be a good indicator of sleep deficiency.  If you feel like you could fall asleep during normal daytime activities such as these, you may be sleep deficient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sitting and reading or watching TV</li>
<li>Sitting still in a public place, such as a movie theater, meeting, or classroom</li>
<li>Riding in a car for an hour without stopping</li>
<li>Sitting and talking to someone</li>
<li>Sitting quietly after lunch</li>
<li>Sitting in traffic for a few minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>To better understand your sleep status and hone in on the amount of sleep that your body requires for optimal functioning, try keeping a sleep diary for a couple of weeks. Write down the amount of sleep you get each night, along with how you feel during the day, including level of alertness, mood, and how rested you feel.  You can do your own sleep study and track other factors such as appetite, energy level, athletic performance, and productivity.  Discover the myriad ways that sleep influences your daily experience.</p>

<h3>Who's at Risk for Sleep Deficiency?</h3>

<p>Sleep deficiency can afflict anyone, regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity.  However, certain groups of people may be at higher risk, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>People with schedules that are not well matched to their natural sleep-wake cycle, such as shift workers, first responders, students with early classes, people who travel for work.</li>
<li>People who have limited time for sleep due to being care-takers, working long hours, or working more than one job.</li>
<li>People who intentionally restrict sleep in favor of staying awake to work, study, or participate in other activities.  This is common in student populations, and within workplace cultures that emphasize high productivity. </li>
<li>People who make a lifestyle choice that interferes with sleep, such as abuse of drugs, alcohol, caffeine, or other drugs or medicines to stay awake, or people who do not allow enough time for sleep each night.</li>
<li>People who have an underlying untreated medical problem or condition, such as stress, anxiety, or sleep disorders.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you suspect that you may have an underlying sleep issue, you may want to participate in a sleep study.  A sleep study can allow your doctor to measure the amount of sleep that you get, your quality of sleep, and the presence and severity of an underlying sleep issue.</p>

<h3>Take-away Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't settle for being sleep deficient.  Sleep is too important to our health and quality of life to ignore or compromise.  If you suspect that you are sleep deficient, take steps to understand the causes and to address them.  Make sleep a priority in your life.  No one else will.</li>
<li>Never drive while drowsy.  If you find yourself driving drowsy, pull over and take a 20-minute nap, switch drivers, or have a cup of coffee or other caffeinated beverage.</li>
<li>If you regularly experience daytime sleepiness, or suspect that you have an underlying sleep issue, contact a sleep professional about participating in a sleep study.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diet, Caffeine and Alcohol</h2>

<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>The relationship between food and sleep is complex. The amount of sleep that you get can have an impact on the types of foods that you crave and body weight regulation. Studies have indicated that getting at least 7 hours of sleep at night can make you less likely to crave sweet, salty and starchy junk foods, while sleep restriction can increase the levels of ghrelin in your body, an appetite stimulating hormone, and can cause you to feel hungrier throughout the day.</p>

<p>Conversely, the types of foods that you eat before bedtime have been shown to impact the quality and quantity of sleep that you get.  The amino acid tryptophan may help you to feel drowsier and is contained within many different types of foods, including seeds and nuts, soy, cheese, red meat and poultry, fish, oats, and eggs.  Recent research has suggested that pre-bedtime meals that are also lower in saturated fat, non-fiber carbohydrates including sugar, and higher in fiber are associated with deeper sleep and fewer nocturnal arousals during sleep.</p>  

<p>While certain foods can promote sleep, the best option is to snack lightly if you must eat immediately before bed.  It is best to finish eating dinner hours before bedtime in order to avoid indigestion. Also, avoid excessive drinking before bedtime in order to avoid nighttime trips to the bathroom.</p>

<h3>Caffeine and Alcohol</h3>
<p>Drinks that contain caffeine, found in tea, coffee, and many energy drinks, can decrease your quality of sleep and should be avoided 4-6 hours before going to bed. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages 3 hours before bed because even though it may initially make you drowsy, it can act as a stimulant and cause you to wake up later during the night.  For quality sleep, it is best to keep alcohol consumption to under 1-2 drinks per day.</p> 

<h3>Take-away Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Strive to get at least 7 hours of sleep every night in order to reduce cravings for unhealthy foods.</li>
<li>Tryptophan containing foods may help you to feel drowsier at night.</li>
<li>Having a dinner that is high in fiber and lower in saturated fat, sugar and other non-fiber carbohydrates may contribute to deeper sleep and less sleep disturbances during the night</li>
<li>Stop eating hours before bedtime in order to avoid indigestion.</li>
<li>Avoid excessive fluid consumption immediately before bedtime to avoid nighttime trips to the bathroom.</li>
<li>Avoid caffeine and alcohol intake at least 3 hours before bedtime for alcohol and 4-6 hours before bedtime for caffeine.</li>
</ul>

<a name='light'/>
<hr/>

<br><br>
<h2>Natural and Artificial Light</h2>
<p>Perhaps you have been amazed at your ability to wake up at the same time every day. Your internal clock, responsible for the sleep-wake cycle, reflects the natural cycles of light and dark. Light influences your behavior, and when you do not receive enough daytime light it interferes with signals to the brain. This disrupts the circadian rhythm and can cause sleepiness, insomnia, and other health problems.  Natural light is important for setting the circadian rhythm. Open your blinds first thing in the morning to let in the light. Try to receive some âsolar powerâ by taking a sun break during the day.</p> 
<p>Minimize your exposure to artificial light in the hours before bed and after dark.  Artificial light and the blue light emitted from electronic screens can influence sleep quality because it suppresses melatonin production. There is some evidence that wearing blue light blocking glasses in the hours before bedtime can help to better prepare the body for sleep.  Also, use dimmer switches to reduce glow from sources of artificial light as bedtime gets closer.  Try to minimize the amount of light in the bedroom, such as from power buttons and streetlamps, because strong artificial light can make it harder to fall asleep.  Use eye-masks, blinds, and curtains to block ambient light.  If you regularly awake in the night to make trips to the bathroom, use a night light instead of a strong overhead light to illuminate the bathroom and pathway.</p>

<br><br>
<h2>The Ideal Temperature and the Body's Thermoregulation</h2>
<p>Your body temperature will naturally lower during sleep, and is in fact required in order to initiate sleep.  Maintaining a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees has been shown to be the most favorable for this dip in body temperature.  A warmer room can interfere with your natural thermoregulation, which can lead to restlessness and may even be associated with insomnia.   In the body's attempts to cool off by sweating, you may find yourself, your pajamas and your mattress damp, which can make it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep.  If the room is too humid, your sweat will not evaporate.  If the room is too cold, you may shiver to increase body temperature, which can also contribute to restless sleep.</p> 
<p>To maintain a cool temperature in the house and bedroom, close the windows and blinds during the day if it is hot outside, and open the windows at night to let in the cool air.  Because heat rises, seek out cooler temperatures for sleep on the lowest floor of the house.  You can use fans to blow the hot air out, or to keep the air flow moving constantly.  In dressing for bed, wear breathable fabric, such as cotton or newer fabrics that can remove moisture can also help to reduce sweating.  Or better yet, sleep in the nude.  Sleeping naked has been shown to allow the body to better regulate its temperature for sleep.</p>

<br><br>
<h2>Noise Pollution and White Noise</h2>

<p>When it comes to sleep, noise pollution can come in many forms, such as road or airport traffic; noisy neighbors; birds chirping; even baby monitors, pets, or a sleeping partner with a different sleep schedule.  All of these can make sleeping difficult.  Using white noise, which is a consistent and soothing ambient sound that can mask other more disruptive sounds, may help you to achieve better sleep.  Ambient sounds include whirring created by an air conditioner or a fan, or any sound that you find calming.  However, not all sounds are calming, even if they are consistent. For example, sometimes you may wake up drowsy and ill-rested, and discover that you have left the TV on all night. TV sounds are constantly changing, which is why they can disturb your sleep. Try to turn off the TV before you go to sleep. If you have a baby monitor, turn it down before you sleep so that you hear when the baby needs you but not their normal sleeping sounds.  You can also try using ear plugs to block out noise.  You can find a link to a number of free white noise websites and phone apps below.</p>

<h3>Take-away Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use white noise to mask disruptive noises that interfere with your sleep.</li>
<li>Turn off the TV before you go to sleep.</li>

<br><br>
<h2>The Bedroom and Bedding</h2>

<h4>Room Design</h4>
<p>Turn your bedroom into a sanctuary for sleep, by creating a sense of peace and calm that can help your body to relax. Important elements include having a space that is clean and free of clutter and distraction. Use colors in the bedroom that you find calming and relaxing. Arrange the furniture or remove unnecessary furniture to simplify the room.  Remove TVs, computers, and other sources of distraction and sources of ambient night-time light.</p>  

<h4>Bedding</h4>
<p>It is important to have a good bed.  Mattress firmness is a personal preference, but your bed and pillow should be comfortable and supportive of your body without making you feel achy and sore the next morning.  Some memory foam materials may trap heat and make it difficult to sleep in the summer.  So, it is important that you find what works for you in your environment.  Most mattresses wear out after 10 years. Consider replacing your mattress if it sags in the middle or at the edges, or if your position shifts when your partner moves. If you are pregnant, lie on your left side if you can because it helps circulation. Replace your pillows when they become shapeless and can no longer support your head and neck. Long pillows that can support your upper body, as well as pillows between your legs, behind your back, or even a thin one under your abdomen can also promote restful sleep.</p>

<h4>Scents</h4>
<p>Your nose is an important factor in restful sleep. Studies have shown that the smell of lavender decreases heart rate and blood pressure, which relaxes you and provides deeper sleep. Most importantly, find a scent that relaxes you.  A few drops of essential oil can be added to the washer when you clean your bedding, or place an essential oil diffuser or potpourri mix in the bedroom.  Use unscented laundry detergents or detergents that have a calming smell, and make an effort to remove offending odors from the bedroom, such as dirty laundry.</p>

<h4>Allergens</h4>
<p>Year-round or seasonal allergies to dust, pollen or mold can interrupt your sleep by causing you to sneeze or sniffle at night. Wash your sheets in hot water once a week and your blankets and pillows regularly. Laundering or drying the pillow at high temperature can help kill dust mites. Clean the surface of your mattress with an upholstery cleaner or sprinkle baking soda to draw out moisture and vacuum it the next day. Vacuum the house regularly and keep your windows closed if you are allergic to pollen. Also consider using an air purifier that removes allergens from the air.</p>

<h3>Take-away Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>simplify the room by removing unnecessary furniture, clutter and distractions such as TVs and computers.</li>
<li>Use calming colors in bedroom</li>
<li>Have a bed that is comfortable and supportive</li>
<li>Use relaxing scents in the bedroom and on bedding, and remove offending odors from the bedroom.</li>
<li>Reduce allergens in the house by washing bedding, vacuuming the house regularly, and using an air purifier. If you are allergic to pollen, close the windows.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maintaining a Sleep Routine</h2>
<p>Having a regular sleep schedule, on both weekdays and weekends, can help you sleep better by setting your internal clock. An hour before you sleep, engage in relaxing activities such as reading, meditation, or taking a bath. Avoid high-stress activities such as rigorous exercise or emotionally-charged conversations because they produce cortisol that increases alertness in the body. Staring at the clock can also cause stress.</p>

<h3>Take-away Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maintain the same sleep and wake schedule, on both weekdays and weekends.</li>
<li>Avoid high-stress and stimulating activities before bed.</li>

<a name='exercise'/>
<hr/>

<br><br>
<h2>When to Exercise or Nap</h2>
<p>Exercising can promote sleep as long as you do it several hours before sleeping and not immediately before going to bed. This is because it stimulates the production of cortisol, which increases your body's alertness and makes it harder to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Late-day naps can also make it more difficult to fall asleep at night.  If you like to take naps, it is best to take short power naps before 5 p.m.</p>   

<h3>Take-away Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finish exercising at least a few hours before bedtime.</li>
<li>If you're a fan of naps, make sure they occur before 5 pm, in order to give your body time to prepare for nighttime sleep.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<h2>Addressing Insomnia and Sleep Apnea</h2>
<h3>Insomnia</h3>
<p>Insomnia is difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, even when a person has the opportunity to sleep. People with insomnia may experience fatigue, low energy, difficulty concentrating, mood disturbances, and decreased performance in work or at school. There are natural treatments for insomnia that don't involve taking medication.  These treatments are collectively referred to as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and include approaches such as cognitive therapy, relaxation training, sleep restriction therapy, and stimulus control therapy.  Cognitive therapy involves working with a sleep therapist to identify underlying harmful beliefs you may have about sleep, and replacing those beliefs with ones that have been shown to improve sleep quality.  Relaxation training, sleep restriction therapy, and stimulus control therapy are behavior changes that one can make on their own to help improve sleep, and there are many resources that are freely available online to guide you through them.  Check out some of these resources below.</p>

<h3>Sleep Apnea</h3>
<p>Sometimes we are unaware of the poor quality of our sleep.  Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep, each pause lasting from a few seconds to minutes.  They may occur 30Â times or more an hour. Sleep apnea usually disrupts your sleep and will often move you from deep sleep into light sleep, and is the leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness.  It afflicts 22 million people in the United States, and 80% of those cases are undiagnosed.  If you are regularly feeling sleepy during the day, or your bed partner has indicated that you are snoring loudly or regularly stop breathing during sleep, you may have sleep apnea.  Other indicators are obesity, waking in the night out of breath, or waking in the morning with dry mouth or a headache.  If you suspect you might have sleep apnea, contact a sleep professional in your area to investigate further.  You can use our Find a Sleep Facility tool (http://www.sleepeducation.org/find-a-facility), or visit the American Sleep Apnea Association website (http://www.sleepapnea.org/index.html) to learn more about the condition.</p>

<h3>Take-away Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are routinely reliant on medications to get to sleep at night, look into addressing your insomnia using more natural methods, such as various cognitive behavioral therapies.</li>
<li>If you regularly experience daytime sleepiness, or your bed partner communicates that you snore loudly or regularly stop breathing during sleep, contact a sleep professional to determine if you might have sleep apnea.</li>
